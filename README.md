- The ideal sorting algorithm would have the following properties:
  - Stable: Equal keys aren’t reordered.
  - Operates in place, requiring O(1) extra space.
  - Worst-case O(n·lg(n)) key comparisons.
  - Worst-case O(n) swaps.
  - Adaptive: Speeds up to O(n) when data is nearly sorted or when there are few unique keys.
-There is no algorithm that has all of these properties, and so the choice of sorting algorithm depends on the application
